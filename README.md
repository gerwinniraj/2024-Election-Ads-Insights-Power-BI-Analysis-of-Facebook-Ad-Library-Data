Leveraged Facebook's Ad Library API to collect and analyze data on the 2024 Indian election ads. Created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics including major themes, spending amounts, and audience sizes across different regions and demographics. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of political ad campaigns by exploring the distribution of ad spend and engagement across various states and demographics. The data-driven approach offers a clear view of campaign strategies, highlighting how different themes resonate with the audience.
